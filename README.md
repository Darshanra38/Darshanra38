Data Collection: You'll need a dataset with features relevant to women's clothing categories. This could include attributes like product description, price, size, color, material, etc.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.

Feature Extraction: Convert text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) if you're using product descriptions.

Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, train a Naive Bayes classifier, and evaluate its performance.

Model Evaluation: Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model.

Here's a basic example in Python using the scikit-learn library:

Step 1: Data Collection
For the sake of this example, let's assume you have a CSV file named womens_clothing.csv.

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('womens_clothing.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataframe
df.head()
Step 2: Data Preprocessing
python
Copy code
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Drop rows with missing values
df.dropna(inplace=True)

# Encode the target variable
le = LabelEncoder()
df['Category'] = le.fit_transform(df['Category'])

# Split the data into features and target variable
X = df.drop('Category', axis=1)
y = df['Category']

# Further split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
Step 3: Feature Extraction
If you have textual data in the descriptions, you can use TF-IDF to convert it into numerical features.

python
Copy code
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

# Assuming 'Description' is the text column
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english', max_features=5000)
X_train_tfidf = tfidf.fit_transform(X_train['Description'])
X_test_tfidf = tfidf.transform(X_test['Description'])

# If you have additional features, concatenate them
import scipy
X_train_combined = scipy.sparse.hstack((X_train_tfidf, X_train.drop('Description', axis=1)))
X_test_combined = scipy.sparse.hstack((X_test_tfidf, X_test.drop('Description', axis=1)))
Step 4: Model Training
python
Copy code
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

# Train the Naive Bayes model
nb = MultinomialNB()
nb.fit(X_train_combined, y_train)
Step 5: Model Evaluation
python
Copy code
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = nb.predict(X_test_combined)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print(f'Classification Report:\n{report}')
